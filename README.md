# Learnifier

How add support for additional mimes? just adjust 'update.types' property
upload.types=image/png,image/jpeg,image/gif

What is missing?
- Tests
- Handling state machine as part of the Metadata class, anyway the logic how I see this is included in: pl.wlodarski.learnifier.metadata.domain.UploadStatus
- OpenApi/JavaDocs
